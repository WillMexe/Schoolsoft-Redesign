# Schoolsoft-Redesign
Schoolsoft Redesign is a css file that makes Schoolsoft's design from 2010 get a facelift.
It still wont look up to modern standards since that would basically need a entire recode.

## What it does

Removes all gradients as they look dated.

## How to use

Install a css editor extension for chrome like the Amino: Live CSS Editor
Paste in the contents of main.css there and you are good to go.
